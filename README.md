# 🧒💻 iWrite Web

**iWrite Web** is a visually engaging, static website designed for **children aged 10–17** who are interested in exploring the world of **web development**, **graphic design**, **game development**, and **early tech job opportunities**.

The project was built to **mirror a Figma design** as closely as possible using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **SVG graphics**. It provides an educational, user-friendly interface that captures young learners’ attention — all while being a static, PC-only web experience.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is **not responsive**. It is built **exclusively for desktop viewports** and will not adapt to mobile or tablet screens.

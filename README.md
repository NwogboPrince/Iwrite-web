# 🎨 Static Web Page (PC-Only) – Figma to Code

This project is a **static webpage** meticulously built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **SVG assets** exported from a **Figma design**. It aims to replicate the original design with high visual fidelity.

> ⚠️ This project is **not responsive** and is intended **only for desktop (PC) screens**. It does not adapt to mobile or tablet viewports.

- 📐 Implemented layout and design with **Bootstrap 5**
- 🖼️ Embedded **SVG graphics** directly exported from Figma
- 🧱 Structured with clean and semantic HTML
- 🎯 Focused on **pixel-perfect desktop design replication**

## 📁 Tech Stack
